# Vida Hostel Lisbon Wireframe Draft

## Global Direction
- **Layout Framework**: Fixed left navigation mirroring reference mock; each menu item loads a dedicated page. Main canvas uses full-bleed photography with translucent overlays for legibility.
- **Accent & Typography**: Accent color `#fff100` for active nav, hover states, and CTA outlines. Headings set in geometric uppercase sans (Futura or similar), body copy in warm serif (Adobe Garamond or equivalent).
- **Logo**: Simple wordmark "VIDA HOSTEL LISBON" rendered in uppercase sans with tight tracking. Use white lettering on dark backgrounds; reserve yellow accent for hover/inverse states.
- **CTA Behavior**: Primary `Book Now` button opens a blank new tab pending integration with external booking engine.
- **Footer**: Consistent across pages with contact details, social icons, legal links, and a dormant Portuguese toggle.
